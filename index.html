<a href="/PotionomicsRecipeFinder">Potionomics Recipe Finder</a> is a program for the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1874490/Potionomics/">Potionomics</a> that runs through all the possible potion recipes given a set of ingredients with a <i>relatively</i> efficient algorithm that can run a few million potential recipes in seconds. Various QoL features added, though it's not particularly pretty as it's function over form.
